Conclusion:
        Amazon Web Services (AWS) can optimise your transcoding using the cloud. Imagine that you manage a website that offers a large number of videos that are viewed globally on desktop computers, mobile devices, and tablets. In an ideal world, you would want to convert them into numerous formats so that various platforms can render them quickly and with the highest quality possible. Transcoding basically entails converting your video files into different formats so they may be viewed on various platforms and devices.
